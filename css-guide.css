/*
REFACTORING TO DO:
	Clean up class names:
		section-code could just be code-box and reused for any code
		section-ol should be renamed something that makes it clear it is a content-list
			inside the section content
		section-table can simply be data-table or content-table and reused
		Add classes where needed to stop element selection (specifically in .nav-side and
			.nav-top)
